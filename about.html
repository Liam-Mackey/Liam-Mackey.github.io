					<p>I have worked in many different fields and in each one I have supplied my best self to contribute to the company. Among the many jobs I have worked probably the most humbling was working on a farm while I was a teen. On the farm I learned the value of discipline and hard work. I also manned the farms shop where they sold vegetables and other types of produce, and when It was slow I was allowed to read my books. Working at that shop I learned the value of patience because hours could go by without customers and I was the only person present at the shop for the hours I worked. My short but experience rich professional life has taught me many lessons. The most important was that with hard work and a positive attitude anything is possible. Listed below are some of the more important jobs I have had.</p>
					<p>When I was 19 years old I began an internship at a small investment banking company. During the first few months I was given textbooks on accounting, finance, and economics and I was instructed to read them. Then twice a week I would come into the office and discuss what I learned, as well as complete assignments for the company. After several months I was able to effectively and accurately read financial statements and use valuations to compare companies.</p>
					<p>I worked at Taglich Brothers for about one year part time as an intern while attending college. Then in the spring of 2015 I was hired as a part time employee working 25 hrs a week by the company. I also did work for their subsidiary company Taglich Private Equity.</p>
					<p>At Taglich Brothers my job description included writing analyst reports that would be viewed by other higher up members of the company. I was also tasked with researching companies that were attending trade/investor conferences that members of Taglich Brothers were attending. Lastly, It was my job to help find companies to sign up for research coverage by Taglich Brothers analysts. I learned a significant amount of Financial Industry Skills at Taglich Brothers. I know the skills I learned there will serve me well throughout my life.</p>
					<p>After being hired by Taglich Brothers I began to work for another sub company of theirs. Taglich Private Equity is a Venture Capitalist company. When working for Taglich PE I managed the company's presence on websites like Deal-Nexus and Axial. In addition to making posts and managing communications on those sites, I also reviewed proposed deals and if I found that the company had an appealing Balance Sheet and Income Statement I would notify my superiors and let them begin to discuss financing or buy outs for the company. At Taglich Brothers I can say that I spent about half my time working for the Research/Banking part of the company and about half on the Private Equity part.</p>
					<p>I graduated from Pierson High School 7th in class with a <b>97.2</b> GPA. Then I went on to study Social Science at Suny Empire State College. I graduated in December 2015 with a GPA of <b>3.89</b>. In addition to taking the required classes for my degree, I also took classes in Computer Programing and the Natural Sciences. </p>
