      I just started attending Dev Bootcamps Phase-0! I am beginning to use git and github. I am also starting to understand what version-control software is exactly. Simply put it allows you to look back at every single edit you made to your files when you saved (or in git language committed) them. It is very helpful in figuring out where and when you made an error in your code. Software like git and github also allow multiple people to work on the same project at once without overwriting each other. This is incredibly helpful when you are working with a team.

        The software for version control, at least on github is git. Git helps you keep track of changes by saving your files and the changes you made to them with commit. Using 'git log' you can also look back at every change you have made. The using the 'HEAD*' tag you can go back to any of your commits and start fresh. It is an amazing system that I hope to use more and more. Git is operated by using the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI was hard to learn at first, but I soon got the hang of it, and now it is really fun to use. I suggest you check it out!

        So what's the difference between Git and Github? Well, git runs locally on your computer whereas Github runs remotely online. Using Github is incredibly important as it helps you share you work with other people. They could be your team or even the entire github community. To use github you need to master the art of the pull request. This request will help you merge the code on your computer onto Github. Once it's up there you can share it with anyone. I do suggest doing some research on licenses before posting your code online. I can't wait to continue learning using git and Github! Have a great week!
