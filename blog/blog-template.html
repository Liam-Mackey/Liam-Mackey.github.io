How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Here is the link to our wireframe "https://github.com/Liam-Mackey/Liam-Mackey.github.io/blob/master/imgs/blog-template-wireframe.png"
I had a blast creating a HTML wireframe with my pair. We both shared a lot of information and learned a lot. He gave me some links to cool wireframing sites and deffinetly made me a better wireframer!
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I absolutley found wireframing helpful it gave me a skeleton to add muscle and skin to to make my website. 
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We decided that a sleek design with multiple tabs and links made a good wireframe. Not to indepth but still effective.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned a lot about the aside and main tags and effectivley used them in my site.
We added the wireframe before the header but it wont be there when we make our blog posts
