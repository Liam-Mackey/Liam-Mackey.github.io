  			<h4 class="head3">Why I made it?</h4>
  			<p class="main-paragraph">
  				The reason I made this blog was to track my progress throughout Dev Bootcamp. I want to be able to look back on my experience and see what it was like when I was at a certain point in the educational experience. I want to see how I struggled with things then accomplished them anyway. Doing that will make it easier for me to reflect and realize that I can take on any challenge because there were times in the past that were really confusing but I got through them. I created this blog, in part, to stay motivated.

  			<h4 class="head3">It's Purpose for the User</h4>
  			<p class="main-paragraph">
  				The purpose of this blog for the user is to give them an idea of what it is like at Dev Bootcamp. If they are thinking of joining they can look at my blog and see how the experience was for me. If the user wants to get an idea of what it is like to be a junior developer in training they can look at my blog. <strong><em>Really you can use this blog for whatever purpose you want!</em></strong>
