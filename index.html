  				<h3 class="head3" >Why?</h3>
  				<section>
  					<p class="main-paragraph" >
  						The reason I made this website is because I am attending Dev Boot Camp (<abbr title="Dev Bootcamp">DBC</abbr>) and this is one of the assignments for week 2. In conjunction with the requirement of making this website I have <strong>always</strong> wanted my own website. So I am glad to finally be making one for myself. I have a strong desire to learn code and web development and I know this is a great place to start. 
  					</p>

  				<h3 class="head3" >What is the Purpose of this Website?</h3>
  				<section>
  					<p class="main-paragraph" >
  						The purpose of this website is to introduce you, the user, to my work and my experience at DBC. On this website you will find links to my Github account as well my blog for <abbr title="Dev Bootcamp">DBC</abbr>. Both of these links will give you the experience of seeing examples of my work and thought process. 
  					</p>
  					<p class="main-paragraph" >
  						On this website you will also find links to my professional career and contacts. There is a link to my Linkedin profile as well as a web page containing further contact information in the navbar at the top of the page. You can also find more simplified contact info at the bottom of this page. 
  					</p>
  					<p class="main-paragraph" >
  						One of the main reasons this website was created, besides being an assignment was to help me find a job after <abbr title="Dev Bootcamp">DBC</abbr>. If you take a look at my page, Github profile, Linkedin, and/or blog, and see something you like feel free to contact me anyway you like.
